    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Phở or pho is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (bánh phở), herbs, and meat 
        (usually beef (phở bò), sometimes chicken (phở gà)). Pho is a popular food in Vietnam[6] where it 
        is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. Nam Định people were the first 
        to create Vietnamese traditional pho. Pho is considered Vietnam's national dish.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
        <li>1 lemongrass stalk, chopped</li>
        <li>2.5cm piece ginger, sliced</li>
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander seeds</li>
        <li>¼ tsp Chinese five spice</li>
        <li>¼ tsp black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1.25 - 1.5 litres good quality fresh chicken stock</li>
        <li>3 large chicken breasts (about 500g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a small frying pan on medium heat and gently cook the shallots and garlic until 
            caramelised and golden brown (about 4-5 mins).</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, add the caramelised shallots and garlic, lemongrass, ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, 
            coriander seeds, Chinese five-spice, peppercorns, sugar, fish sauce, chicken stock and chicken breasts. Cover with a 
            lid and bring to a very gentle simmer for about 15 mins.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the noodles, following pack instructions, until just cooked through (do not over-cook). Rinse under 
            cold water to prevent them sticking together. Drain and divide between serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Strain the soup through a sieve. Discard the spices. Shred the chicken and keep to one side. Return soup to the pot 
            and bring to a boil. Season to taste with more fish sauce if needed.</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle piping hot soup into bowls of noodles and chicken, and top with spring onion, carrot, bean sprouts, 
            and herbs, plus the chili, crispy shallots and kaffir lime leaf if using. Serve with a lime wedge to squeeze over, 
            and more fish sauce and chili to taste.</li>
    </ol>
