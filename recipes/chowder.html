    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Chowder is a thick soup prepared with milk or cream, a roux, and seafood or vegetables. Oyster crackers 
        or saltines may accompany chowders as a side item, and cracker pieces may be dropped atop the dish. 
        New England clam chowder is typically made with chopped clams and diced potatoes, in a mixed cream and 
        milk base, often with a small amount of butter. Other common chowders include seafood chowder, which includes 
        fish, clams, and many other types of shellfish; lamb or veal chowder made with barley; corn chowder, which 
        uses corn instead of clams; a wide variety of fish chowders; and potato chowder, which is often made with 
        cheese. Fish, corn and clam chowder are popular in North America, especially New England and Atlantic Canada.</h3>
